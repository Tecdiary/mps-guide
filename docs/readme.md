# Welcome to MPS Docs (WIP)

#### Modern POS Solution Documentation (version 1.0)

## About MPS

**Modern POS Solution** (**MPS**) is all in once business solution developed by **Tecdiray IT Solutions**.

MPS is developed using **vue** (front-end) and **laravel** (back-end). All licenses come with source code of back-end but the front-end source code is not included in regular license. If you need to modify the item's front-end for yourself or your clients then you will need to purchase developer or extended license.
