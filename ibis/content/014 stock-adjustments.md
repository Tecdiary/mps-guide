# Stock Adjustments



## Stock Adjustments

Stock/Inventory Adjustment is used to synchronize the stock to account for things that occur outside the normal business like theft, breakages, spillages, faulty or damaged goods, data entry error etc. Stock Adjustment functionality allows you to modify the stock of items and indicate the reason for that adjustment.

Stock Adjustment page has Date, Reference, Type, Total, Attachments, Created by, Draft, Custom Fields, Details, Created at and Actions columns. You can view, edit and delete any adjustment. The inventory adjustments table can be sorted for date, reference, type and searched/filtered for date, reference, type and created by.

The add adjustment page has the following fields

1.  Date
2.  Type
3.  Reference
4.  Adjustment products - you can search products or scan barcode
5.  Custom Fields
6.  Attachments
7.  Details
8.  Draft - if transfer is still a draft

Once you unchecked the draft, the transfer will be finalized and the stock will be synchronized.
